            The 2025 FIA Formula One World Championship is an ongoing motor racing championship for Formula One cars and
            the 76th running of the Formula One World Championship. It is recognised by the Fédération Internationale de
            l'Automobile (FIA), the governing body of international motorsport, as the highest class of competition for
            open-wheel racing cars. The championship is contested over twenty-four Grands Prix held around the world. It
            began in March and will end in December.<br><br>    

            Drivers and teams compete for the titles of World Drivers' Champion and World Constructors' Champion,
            respectively. Max Verstappen, driving for Red Bull Racing-Honda RBPT, is the reigning Drivers' Champion,[1]
            while McLaren-F1, who were the reigning Constructors' Champions, secured their tenth title, and second
            in a row, at the Singapore Grand Prix, the first time McLaren had won consecutive constructors' titles since
            1991.<br><br>

            The 2025 season is the last year to utilise the power unit configuration introduced in 2014. A revised
            configuration without the Motor Generator Unit-Heat (MGU-H), but with a higher power output from the Motor
            Generator Unit-Kinetic (MGU-K), will be introduced for 2026.[2] 2025 also marks the final year of the
            ground-effect generation of cars introduced in 2022, and the last year of the drag reduction system (DRS)
            introduced as an overtaking aid in 2011, as cars with active aerodynamics and moveable wings will be
            introduced in 2026.[3]<br><br>

            2025 also marks Renault's final season as an active engine supplier for its team Alpine, with the
            manufacturer planning to discontinue engine production post-2025.[4]
